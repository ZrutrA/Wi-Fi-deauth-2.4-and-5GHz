# Wi-Fi-deauth-2.4-and-5GHz
Wi-Fi deauth attack 2.4 GHz and 5 Ghz

## About this project
This is a bash script for Linux. I provide versions in English and Polish.

Enables a deauthentication attack on a Wi-Fi network. It combines two attack methods: on the network operating at 2.4 GHz and on the 5 GHz network. You can only perform one type of attack at a time.
